# HealthFast - Proactive Symptom Management App

## Overview
HealthFast is a mobile app designed to empower individuals to proactively manage chronic symptoms and improve their health while reducing the burden on healthcare systems. The app provides personalized over-the-counter medication recommendations, locates nearby pharmacies, and offers lifestyle change suggestions tailored to users’ health data. Additionally, it includes mindfulness tips and stress-relief exercises to support mental well-being.

This project leverages AI technologies such as speech-to-text, computer vision, and large language models (LLMs) with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to provide accurate and actionable insights for users. The app prioritizes ethical considerations, including privacy, transparency, and accessibility, to create a user-friendly experience for all demographics.

## Statement on LLM Usage
Aspects of the code were troubleshooted using DeepSeek. DeepSeek was also used to help understand certain AI and web development concepts used in the development of the app. The entire chat history is documented and available in `llm/llm_usage.txt`.
